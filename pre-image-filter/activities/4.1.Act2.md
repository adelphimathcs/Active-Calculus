### Activities

\[A:4.1.2\] A ball is tossed vertically in such a way that its velocity
function is given by $v(t) = 32 - 32t$, where $t$ is measured in seconds
and $v$ in feet per second. Assume that this function is valid for
$0 \le t \le 2$.

1.  For what values of $t$ is the velocity of the ball positive? What
    does this tell you about the motion of the ball on this interval of
    time values?

2.  Find an antiderivative, $s$, of $v$ that satisfies $s(0) = 0$.

3.  Compute the value of $s(1) - s(\frac{1}{2})$. What is the meaning of
    the value you find?

4.  Using the graph of $y = v(t)$ provided in FigureÂ \[F:4.1.Act2\],
    find the exact area of the region under the velocity curve between
    $t = \frac{1}{2}$ and $t = 1$. What is the meaning of the value you
    find?

5.  Answer the same questions as in (c) and (d) but instead using the
    interval $[0,1]$.

6.  What is the value of $s(2) - s(0)$? What does this result tell you
    about the flight of the ball? How is this value connected to the
    provided graph of $y = v(t)$? Explain.

\[A:4.1.3\] Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has
its velocity $v$ (in meters per second) at time $t$ (in seconds) given
by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured in
Figure \[F:4.1.Act3\]. We view movement to the right as being in the
positive direction (with positive velocity), while movement to the left
is in the negative direction.

Suppose further that the object’s initial position at time $t = 0$ is
$s(0) = 1$.

1.  Determine the total distance traveled and the total change in
    position on the time interval $0 \le t \le 2$. What is the object’s
    position at $t = 2$?

2.  On what time intervals is the moving object’s position function
    increasing? Why? On what intervals is the object’s position
    decreasing? Why?

3.  What is the object’s position at $t = 8$? How many total meters has
    it traveled to get to this point (including distance in both
    directions)? Is this different from the object’s total change in
    position on $t = 0$ to $t = 8$?

4.  Find the exact position of the object at $t = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 8$
    and use this data to sketch an accurate graph of $y = s(t)$ on the
    axes provided at right. How can you use the provided information
    about $y = v(t)$ to determine the concavity of $s$ on each relevant
    interval?

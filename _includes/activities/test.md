\begin{activity} \label{A:4.1.1}  Suppose that a person is walking in such a way that her velocity varies slightly according to the information given in the table below and graph given in Figure~\ref{F:4.1.Act1}.
\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
%\hline
$t$ & 0.00 & $0.25$ & $0.50$ & $0.75$ & 1.00 & $1.25$ & $1.50$ & $1.75$ & $2.00$ \\ \hline %\hline
$v(t)$ & $1.500$ & $1.789$ & $1.938$ & $1.992$ & $2.000$ & $2.008$ & $2.063$ & $2.211$ & $2.500$ \\ %\hline

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using the grid, graph, and given data appropriately, estimate the distance traveled by the walker during the two hour interval from $t = 0$ to $t = 2$.  You should use time intervals of width $\triangle t = 0.5$, choosing a way to use the function consistently to determine the height of each rectangle in order to approximate distance traveled.
	\item How could you get a better approximation of the distance traveled on $[0,2]$?  Explain, and then find this new estimate.
	\item Now suppose that you know that $v$ is given by $v(t) = 0.5t^3-1.5t^2+1.5t+1.5$. Remember that $v$ is the derivative of the walker's position function, $s$.  Find a formula for $s$ so that $s' = v$.
	\item Based on your work in (c), what is the value of $s(2) - s(0)$?  What is the meaning of this quantity?

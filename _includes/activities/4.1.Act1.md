### Activities

\[A:4.1.1\] Suppose that a person is walking in such a way that her
velocity varies slightly according to the information given in the table
below and graph given in Figure \[F:4.1.Act1\].

    $t$      0.00     $0.25$    $0.50$    $0.75$     1.00     $1.25$    $1.50$    $1.75$    $2.00$
  -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
   $v(t)$   $1.500$   $1.789$   $1.938$   $1.992$   $2.000$   $2.008$   $2.063$   $2.211$   $2.500$

1.  Using the grid, graph, and given data appropriately, estimate the
    distance traveled by the walker during the two hour interval from
    $t = 0$ to $t = 2$. You should use time intervals of width
    $\triangle t = 0.5$, choosing a way to use the function consistently
    to determine the height of each rectangle in order to approximate
    distance traveled.

2.  How could you get a better approximation of the distance traveled on
    $[0,2]$? Explain, and then find this new estimate.

3.  Now suppose that you know that $v$ is given by
    $v(t) = 0.5t^3-1.5t^2+1.5t+1.5$. Remember that $v$ is the derivative
    of the walker’s position function, $s$. Find a formula for $s$ so
    that $s' = v$.

4.  Based on your work in (c), what is the value of $s(2) - s(0)$? What
    is the meaning of this quantity?

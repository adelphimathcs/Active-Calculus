### Preview Activity \[PA:4.1\] 

Suppose that a person is taking a walk along a long straight
path and walks at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour.

1.  On the left-hand axes provided in Figure \[F:4.1.PA1\], sketch a
    labeled graph of the velocity function $v(t) = 3$.

    ![At left, axes for plotting $y = v(t)$; at right, for plotting
    $y = s(t)$.<span
    data-label="F:4.1.PA1"></span>](figures/4_1_PA1.eps)

    Note that while the scale on the two sets of axes is the same, the
    units on the right-hand axes differ from those on the left. The
    right-hand axes will be used in question (d).

2.  How far did the person travel during the two hours? How is this
    distance related to the area of a certain region under the graph of
    $y = v(t)$?

3.  Find an algebraic formula, $s(t)$, for the position of the person at
    time $t$, assuming that $s(0) = 0$. Explain your thinking.

4.  On the right-hand axes provided in Figure \[F:4.1.PA1\], sketch a
    labeled graph of the position function $y = s(t)$.

5.  For what values of $t$ is the position function $s$ increasing?
    Explain why this is the case using relevant information about the
    velocity function $v$.

<p>\subsection*{Introduction}</p>

<p>Calculus can be viewed broadly as the study of change. A natural and important question to ask about any changing quantity is &#8220;how fast is the quantity changing?&#8221; It turns out that in order to make the answer to this question precise, substantial mathematics is required. </p>

<p>We begin with a familiar problem: a ball being tossed straight up in the air from an initial height. From this elementary scenario, we will ask questions about how the ball is moving. These questions will lead us to begin investigating ideas that will be central throughout our study of differential calculus and that have wide-ranging consequences. In a great deal of our thinking about calculus, we will be well-served by remembering this first example and asking ourselves how the various (sometimes abstract) ideas we are considering are related to the simple act of tossing a ball straight up in the air. </p>

<p>\subsection*{Position and average velocity}</p>

<p>Any moving object has a \emph{position}\index{position} that can be considered a function of \emph{time}. When this motion is along a straight line, the position is given by a single variable, and we usually let this position be denoted by <span class="math">\(s(t)\)</span>, which reflects the fact that position is a function of time. For example, we might view <span class="math">\(s(t)\)</span> as telling the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> in hours; similarly, the function <span class="math">\(s\)</span> described in Preview Activity \ref{PA:1.1} is a position function, where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.</p>

<p>Not only does such a moving object have a position associated with its motion, but on any time interval, the object has an \emph{average velocity}\index{average velocity}. Think, for example, about driving from one location to another: the vehicle travels some number of miles over a certain time interval (measured in hours), from which we can compute the vehicle&#8217;s average velocity. In this situation, average velocity is the number of miles traveled divided by the time elapsed, which of course is given in \emph{miles per hour}. Similarly, the calculation of <span class="math">\(AV_{[0.5,1]}\)</span> in Preview Activity \ref{PA:1.1} found the average velocity of the ball on the time interval <span class="math">\([0.5,1]\)</span>, measured in feet per second.</p>

<p>In general, we make the following definition: for an object moving in a straight line whose position at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is given by the function <span class="math">\(s(t)\)</span>, the \emph{average velocity\index{average velocity} of the object on the interval from <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t = b$}, denoted $AV_{[a,b]}\)</span>, is given by the formula
<span class="math">\[AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}.\]</span>
Note well: the units on <span class="math">\(AV_{[a,b]}\)</span> are
<code>units of $s$ per unit of $t$,'' such as</code>miles per hour&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;feet per second.&#8221;</p>

<p>\subsection*{Instantaneous Velocity}</p>

<p>Whether driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball, we have an intuitive sense that any moving object has a velocity at any given moment &#8211; a number that measures how fast the object is moving \emph{right now}. For instance, a car&#8217;s speedometer tells the driver what appears to be the car&#8217;s velocity at any given instant. In fact, the posted velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval (by computing how many revolutions the tires have undergone to compute distance traveled), since velocity fundamentally comes from considering a change in position divided by a change in time. But if we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter, then we can progress from average velocity to \emph{instantaneous} velocity. </p>

<p>Informally, we define the \emph{instantaneous velocity}\index{instantaneous velocity} of a moving object at time <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span> to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span> to compute the average velocity. We will develop a more formal definition of this momentarily, one that will end up being the foundation of much of our work in first semester calculus. For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity this way: take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals, and if those average velocities approach a single number, then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.</p>

<p>\input{activities/1.1.Act2}
%\br</p>

<p>At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, as well as how each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, we will introduce the notion of \emph{limit} in Section~\ref{S:1.2.Limits}. As a preview of that concept, we look at a way to consider the limiting value of average velocity through the introduction of a parameter. Note that if we desire to know the instantaneous velocity at <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span> of a moving object with position function <span class="math">\(s\)</span>, we are interested in computing average velocities on the interval <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span> for smaller and smaller intervals. One way to visualize this is to think of the value <span class="math">\(b\)</span> as being <span class="math">\(b = a + h\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is a small number that is allowed to vary. Thus, we observe that the average velocity of the object on the interval <span class="math">\([a,a+h]\)</span> is
<span class="math">\[AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h},\]</span>
with the denominator being simply <span class="math">\(h\)</span> because <span class="math">\((a+h) - a = h\)</span>. Initially, it is fine to think of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> being a small positive real number; but it is important to note that we allow <span class="math">\(h\)</span> to be a small negative number, too, as this enables us to investigate the average velocity of the moving object on intervals prior to <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span>, as well as following <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(h < 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(AV_{[a,a+h]}\)</span> measures the average velocity on the interval <span class="math">\([a+h,a]\)</span>. </p>

<p>To attempt to find the instantaneous velocity at <span class="math">\(t = a\)</span>, we investigate what happens as the value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> approaches zero. We consider this further in the following example.</p>

<p>\bex
For a falling ball whose position function is given by <span class="math">\(s(t) = 16 - 16t^2\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is measured in feet and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> in seconds), find an expression for the average velocity of the ball on a time interval of the form <span class="math">\([0.5, 0.5+h]\)</span> where <span class="math">\(-0.5 < h < 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h \ne 0\)</span>. Use this expression to compute the average velocity on <span class="math">\([0.5,0.75]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([0.4,0.5]\)</span>, as well as to make a conjecture about the instantaneous velocity at <span class="math">\(t = 0.5\)</span>.
\eex
We make the assumptions that <span class="math">\(-0.5 < h < 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h \ne 0\)</span> because <span class="math">\(h\)</span> cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval <span class="math">\(0 \le t \le 1\)</span>, as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. Observe that we want to compute and simplify <span class="math">\[AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}.\]</span> The most unusual part of this computation is finding <span class="math">\(s(0.5+h)\)</span>. To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function <span class="math">\(s\)</span>. In particular, since <span class="math">\(s(t) = 16-16t^2\)</span>, we see that \begin{eqnarray<em>}
 s(0.5+h) &amp; = &amp; 16 - 16(0.5 + h)^2 \
 &amp; = &amp; 16 - 16(0.25 + h + h<sup>2</sup>) \
 &amp; = &amp; 16 - 4 - 16h - 16h<sup>2</sup> \
 &amp; = &amp; 12 - 16h - 16h<sup>2</sup>.
\end{eqnarray</em>}
Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that
\begin{eqnarray*}
 AV<em>{[0.5, 0.5+h]} &amp; = &amp; \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5} \
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h<sup>2</sup>) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5} \
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{12 - 16h - 16h<sup>2</sup> - 12}{h} \
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{&#8211;16h - 16h<sup>2}{h}</sup>.
\end{eqnarray*}
At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, which it must, since as <span class="math">\(h\)</span> changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since <span class="math">\(h\)</span> can never equal zero, we may further simplify the most recent expression. Removing the common factor of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> from the numerator and denominator, it follows that
$$ AV</em>{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = &#8211;16 - 16h.$$
Now, for any small positive or negative value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, we can compute the average velocity. For instance, to obtain the average velocity on <span class="math">\([0.5,0.75]\)</span>, we let <span class="math">\(h = 0.25\)</span>, and the average velocity is <span class="math">\(-16 - 16(0.25) = -20\)</span> ft/sec. To get the average velocity on <span class="math">\([0.4, 0.5]\)</span>, we let <span class="math">\(h = -0.1\)</span>, which tells us the average velocity is <span class="math">\(-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\)</span> ft/sec. Moreover, we can even explore what happens to <span class="math">\(AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}\)</span> as <span class="math">\(h\)</span> gets closer and closer to zero. As <span class="math">\(h\)</span> approaches zero, <span class="math">\(-16h\)</span> will also approach zero, and thus it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <span class="math">\(t = 0.5\)</span> should be <span class="math">\(-16\)</span> ft/sec.

\item The instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time is estimated by considering average velocities on shorter and shorter time intervals that contain the instant of interest.

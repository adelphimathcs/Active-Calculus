# Active-Calculus

This is an attempt to use pandoc to create a markdown version of the Active Calculus text. The goal is to create an interactive web interface that would use JS or html 5 instead of Geogebra. Also, we would like a markdown version of the book that could be transformed into TeX, epub, html, etc. via pandoc. 

If you are interested in helping out with the project, leave a request with Issue #1.

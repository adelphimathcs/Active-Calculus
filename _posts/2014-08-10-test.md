Determining distance traveled from velocity {#S:4.1.VelocityDistance}
===========================================

Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}
------------

In the very first section of the text, we considered a situation where a
moving object had a known position at time $t$. In particular, we
stipulated that a tennis ball tossed into the air had its height $s$ (in
feet) at time $t$ (in seconds) given by $s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2$. From
this starting point, we investigated the average velocity of the ball on
a given interval $[a,b]$, computed by the difference quotient
$\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}$, and eventually found that we could determine
the exact instantaneous velocity of the ball at time $t$ by taking the
derivative of the position function, 

$$s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}.$$ 

Thus, given a
differentiable position function, we are able to know the exact velocity
of the moving object at any point in time.

Moreover, from this foundational problem involving position and velocity
we have learned a great deal. Given a differentiable function $f$, we
are now able to find its derivative and use this derivative to determine
the function’s instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain,
as well as to find where the function is increasing or decreasing, is
concave up or concave down, and has relative extremes. The vast majority
of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the
situation where a particular function is known and we seek information
that relies on knowing the function’s instantaneous rate of change. That
is, we have typically proceeded from a function $f$ to its derivative,
$f'$, and then used the meaning of the derivative to help us answer
important questions.

In a much smaller number of situations so far, we have encountered the
reverse situation where we instead know the derivative, $f'$, and have
tried to deduce information about $f$. It is this particular problem
that will be the focus of our attention in most of Chapter \[C:4\]: if
we know the instantaneous rate of change of a function, are we able to
determine the function itself? To begin, we start with a more focused
question: if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object moving
along a straight line path, can we determine its corresponding position
function?

Area under the graph of the velocity function {#area-under-the-graph-of-the-velocity-function .unnumbered}
---------------------------------------------

In Preview Activity \[PA:4.1\], we encountered a fundamental fact: when
a moving object’s velocity is constant (and positive), the area under
the velocity curve over a given interval tells us the distance the
object traveled.

![At left, a constant velocity function; at right, a non-constant velocity function.](figures/4_1_VelArea.png)




As seen at left in Figure \[F:4.1.VelArea\], if we consider an object
moving at 2 miles per hour over the time interval $[1,1.5]$, then the
area $A_1$ of the shaded region under $y = v(t)$ on $[1,1.5]$ is
$$A _1= 2 \, \frac{\mbox{miles}}{\mbox{hour}} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \mbox{hours} = 1 \, \mbox{mile}.$$
This principle holds in general simply due to the fact that distance
equals rate times time, provided the rate is constant. Thus, if $v(t)$
is constant on the interval $[a,b]$, then the distance traveled on
$[a,b]$ is the area $A$ that is given by
$$A = v(a) (b-a) = v(a) \triangle t,$$ where $\triangle t$ is the change
in $t$ over the interval. Note, too, that we could use any value of
$v(t)$ on the interval $[a,b]$, since the velocity is constant; we
simply chose $v(a)$, the value at the interval’s left endpoint. For
several examples where the velocity function is piecewise constant, see

The situation is obviously more complicated when the velocity function
is not constant. At the same time, on relatively small intervals on
which $v(t)$ does not vary much, the area principle allows us to
estimate the distance the moving object travels on that time interval.
For instance, for the non-constant velocity function shown at right in
Figure \[F:4.1.VelArea\], we see that on the interval $[1,1.5]$,
velocity varies from $v(1) = 2.5$ down to $v(1.5) \approx 2.1$. Hence,
one estimate for distance traveled is the area of the pictured
rectangle,
$$A_2 = v(1) \triangle t = 2.5 \, \frac{\mbox{miles}}{\mbox{hour}} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \mbox{hours} = 1.25 \, \mbox{miles}.$$
Because $v$ is decreasing on $[1,1.5]$ and the rectangle lies above the
curve, clearly $A_2 = 1.25$ is an over-estimate of the actual distance
traveled.

If we want to estimate the area under the non-constant velocity function
on a wider interval, say $[0,3]$, it becomes apparent that one rectangle
probably will not give a good approximation. Instead, we could use the
six rectangles pictured in Figure \[F:4.1.VelArea2\],

![Using six rectangles to estimate the area under $y = v(t)$ on $[0,3]$.<spandata-label="F:4.1.VelArea2"></span>](figures/4_1_VelArea2.png)

![Using six rectangles to estimate the area under $y = v(t)$ on $[0,3]$.](figures/4_1_VelArea2.png)

find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total. Obviously there
are choices to make and issues to understand: how many rectangles should
we use? where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle’s
height? what happens if velocity is sometimes negative? can we attain
the exact area under any non-constant curve? These questions and more
are ones we will study in what follows; for now it suffices to realize
that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool
for estimating both distance traveled from a velocity function as well
as the area under an arbitrary curve. To explore the setting of multiple
rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function,
see the applet found at
[`http://gvsu.edu/s/9U`](http://gvsu.edu/s/9U).[^2]

Two approaches: area and antidifferentiation {#two-approaches-area-and-antidifferentiation .unnumbered}
--------------------------------------------

When the velocity of a moving object is positive, the object’s position
is always increasing. While we will soon consider situations where
velocity is negative and think about the ramifications of this condition
on distance traveled, for now we continue to assume that we are working
with a positive velocity function. In that setting, we have established
that whenever $v$ is actually constant, the exact distance traveled on
an interval is the area under the velocity curve; furthermore, we have
observed that when $v$ is not constant, we can estimate the total
distance traveled by finding the areas of rectangles that help to
approximate the area under the velocity curve on the given interval.
Hence, we see the importance of the problem of finding the area between
a curve and the horizontal axis: besides being an interesting geometric
question, in the setting of the curve being the (positive) velocity of a
moving object, the area under the curve over an interval tells us the
exact distance traveled on the interval. We can estimate this area any
time we have a graph of the velocity function or a table of data that
tells us some relevant values of the function.

In Activity \[A:4.1.1\], we also encountered an alternate approach to
finding the distance traveled. In particular, if we know a formula for
the instantaneous velocity, $y = v(t)$, of the moving body at time $t$,
then we realize that $v$ must be the derivative of some corresponding
position function $s$. If we can find a formula for $s$ from the formula
for $v$, it follows that we know the position of the object at time $t$.
In addition, under the assumption that velocity is positive, the change
in position over a given interval then tells us the distance traveled on
that interval.

For a simple example, consider the situation from Preview
Activity \[PA:4.1\], where a person is walking along a straight line and
has velocity function $v(t) = 3$ mph.

![The velocity function $v(t) = 3$ and corresponding position function $s(t) = 3t$.<span data-label="F:4.1.PA1Soln"></span>](figures/4_1_PA1Soln.png)

As pictured in Figure \[F:4.1.PA1Soln\], we see the already noted
relationship between area and distance traveled on the left-hand graph
of the velocity function. In addition, because the velocity is constant
at 3, we know that if[^3] $s(t) = 3t$, then $s'(t) = 3$, so $s(t) = 3t$
is a function whose derivative is $v(t)$. Furthermore, we now observe
that $s(1.5) = 4.5$ and $s(0.25) = 0.75$, which are the respective
locations of the person at times $t = 0.25$ and $t = 1.5$, and therefore
$$s(1.5) - s(0.25) = 4.5 - 0.75 = 3.75 \ \mbox{miles}.$$ This is not
only the change in position on $[0.25,1.5]$, but also precisely the
distance traveled on $[0.25,1.5]$, which can also be computed by finding
the area under the velocity curve over the same interval. There are
profound ideas and connections present in this example that we will
spend much of the remainder of Chapter \[C:4\] studying and exploring.

For now, it is most important to observe that if we are given a formula
for a velocity function $v$, it can be very helpful to find a function
$s$ that satisfies $s = v'$. In this context, we say that $s$ is an
*antiderivative* of $v$. More generally, just as we say that $f'$ is the
derivative of $f$ for a given function $f$, if we are given a function
$g$ and $G$ is a function such that $G' = g$, we say that $G$ is an
*antiderivative* of $g$. For example, if $g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x$, an
antiderivative of $g$ is $G(x) = x^3 + x^2$, since $G'(x) = g(x)$. Note
that we say “an” antiderivative of $g$ rather than “the” antiderivative
of $g$ because $H(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 5$ is also a function whose
derivative is $g$, and thus $H$ is another antiderivative of $g$.

When velocity is negative {#when-velocity-is-negative .unnumbered}
-------------------------

Most of our work in this section has occurred under the assumption that
velocity is positive. This hypothesis guarantees that the movement of
the object under consideration is always in a single direction, and
hence ensures that the moving body’s change in position is the same as
the distance it travels on a given interval. As we saw in
Activity \[A:4.1.2\], there are natural settings in which a moving
object’s velocity is negative; we would like to understand this scenario
fully as well.

Consider a simple example where a person goes for a walk on a beach
along a stretch of very straight shoreline that runs east-west. We can
naturally assume that their initial position is $s(0) = 0$, and further
stipulate that their position function increases as they move east from
their starting location. For instance, a position of $s = 1$ mile
represents being one mile east of the start location, while $s = -1$
tells us the person is one mile west of where they began walking on the
beach. Now suppose the person walks in the following manner. From the
outset at $t = 0$, the person walks due east at a constant rate of $3$
mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, the person stops abruptly and begins
walking due west at the constant rate of $4$ mph and does so for 0.5
hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, the person resumes
walking at a constant rate of $3$ mph to the east for one more hour.
What is the total distance the person traveled on the time interval
$t = 0$ to $t = 3$? What is the person’s total change in position over
that time?

On one hand, these are elementary questions to answer because the
velocity involved is constant on each interval. From $t = 0$ to
$t = 1.5$, the person traveled
$$D_{[0,1.5]} = 3 \ \mbox{miles per hour} \cdot 1.5 \ \mbox{hours} = 4.5 \ \mbox{miles}.$$
Similarly, on $t = 1.5$ to $t = 2$, having a different rate, the
distance traveled is
$$D_{[1.5,2]} = 4 \ \mbox{miles per hour} \cdot 0.5 \ \mbox{hours} = 2 \ \mbox{miles}.$$
Finally, similar calculations reveal that in the final hour, the person
walked
$$D_{[2,3]} = 3 \ \mbox{miles per hour} \cdot 1 \ \mbox{hours} = 3 \ \mbox{miles},$$
so the total distance traveled is
$$D = D_{[0,1.5]} + D_{[1.5,2]} + D_{[2,3]} = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \mbox{miles}.$$
Since the velocity on $1.5 < t < 2$ is actually $v = -4$, being negative
to indication motion in the westward direction, this tells us that the
person first walked 4.5 miles east, then 2 miles west, followed by 3
more miles east. Thus, the walker’s total change in position is
$$\mbox{change in position} = 4.5 - 2 + 3 = 5.5 \ \mbox{miles}.$$

While we have been able to answer these questions fairly easily, it is
also important to think about this problem graphically in order that we
can generalize our solution to the more complicated setting when
velocity is not constant, as well as to note the particular impact that
negative velocity has.

![At left, the velocity function of the person walking; at right, the corresponding position function.<span data-label="F:4.1.NegVel"></span>](figures/4_1_NegVel.png)

In Figure \[F:4.1.NegVel\], we see how the distances we computed above
can be viewed as areas: $A_1 = 4.5$ comes from taking rate times time
($3 \cdot 1.5$), as do $A_2$ and $A_3$ for the second and third
rectangles. The big new issue is that while $A_2$ is an area (and is
therefore positive), because this area involves an interval on which the
velocity function is negative, its area has a negative sign associated
with it. This helps us to distinguish between distance traveled and
change in position.

The distance traveled is the sum of the areas,
$$D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \mbox{miles}.$$ But the
change in position has to account for the sign associated with the area,
where those above the $t$-axis are considered positive while those below
the $t$-axis are viewed as negative, so that
$$s(3) - s(0) = (+4.5) + (-2) + (+3) = 5.5 \ \mbox{miles},$$ assigning
the “$-2$” to the area in the interval $[1.5,2]$ because there velocity
is negative and the person is walking in the “negative” direction. In
other words, the person walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction,
followed by two miles in the negative direction, and then 3 more miles
in the positive direction. This affect of velocity being negative is
also seen in the graph of the function $y=s(t)$, which has a negative
slope (specifically, its slope is $-4$) on the interval $1.5<t<2$ since
the velocity is $-4$ on that interval, which shows the person’s position
function is decreasing due to the fact that she is walking east, rather
than west. On the intervals where she is walking west, the velocity
function is positive and the slope of the position function $s$ is
therefore also positive.

To summarize, we see that if velocity is sometimes negative, this makes
the moving object’s change in position different from its distance
traveled. By viewing the intervals on which velocity is positive and
negative separately, we may compute the distance traveled on each such
interval, and then depending on whether we desire total distance
traveled or total change in position, we may account for negative
velocities that account for negative change in position, while still
contributing positively to total distance traveled. We close this
section with one additional activity that further explores the effects
of negative velocity on the problem of finding change in position and
total distance traveled.

If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given
interval and the velocity is positive throughout, we can estimate the
object’s distance traveled and in some circumstances determine this
value exactly.

In particular, when velocity is positive on an interval, we can find the
total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity curve and
above the $t$-axis on the given time interval. We may only be able to
estimate this area, depending on the shape of the velocity curve.

The antiderivative of a function $f$ is a new function $F$ whose
derivative is $f$. That is, $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ provided
that $F' = f$. In the context of velocity and position, if we know a
velocity function $v$, an antiderivative of $v$ is a position function
$s$ that satisfies $s' = v$. If $v$ is positive on a given interval, say
$[a,b]$, then the change in position, $s(b) - s(a)$, measures the
distance the moving object traveled on $[a,b]$.

In the setting where velocity is sometimes negative, this means that the
object is sometimes traveling in the opposite direction (depending on
whether velocity is positive or negative), and thus involves the object
backtracking. To determine distance traveled, we have to think about the
problem separately on intervals where velocity is positive and negative
and account for the change in position on each such interval.
